# ChedLog

## Unleash the Power of Your Discord Tokens

Introducing **ChedLog**, the ultimate utility tool designed to provide seamless access to your Discord tokens from various local clients, including **Discordapp**, **Discord Canary**, **Discord PTB**, and even your **web browsers**. Additionally, most custom or modded clients should also be accessible. If any clients are missing, feel free to make a pull request or send the client name, and it will be reviewed.

### Why ChedLog?

- **Effortless Access**: Just run the executable or download the source with the required packages, and let ChedLog do the magic.
- **Instant Token Display**: Instantly see all your logged-in tokens, complete with usernames if they're valid.
- **Quick Copy**: Easily copy any token to your clipboard by specifying the number next to it.

No more hassle, no more digging through files, or Browser Tools. With ChedLog, your Discord tokens are just a few clicks away. Get ready to experience Discord like never before!

Side note, For future reference, if you're going to paste my code into another project, please at least credit me as the person you got it from, i've now seen a few reskinned versions of this online with no credit at all :)

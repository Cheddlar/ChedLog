# ChedLog

## This was primarily designed because I am lazy and don't want to have to open Discord on the website to get my token every time.

Grabs your discord token from local discord clients and browsers and pastes it into the console, cba making it so it displays the name of the account. If you want to send me a fix or PR and fix it, be my guest!

### This is not a token logger, don't believe me? Don't use it. It is literally open source lmao.
